# Action Plan: VestSmart Development  
*Created by Cauã Victor*  

## Overview  
The goal of this 6-month plan is to develop VestSmart, a sophisticated chatbot for Brazilian vestibulares using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. This plan outlines the tasks for each month, resources to use, and methods to ensure successful completion.

## Month 1: December 2024  
### Goals  
1. **Data Collection**: Reach out to public and private institutions to obtain access to large public datasets relevant to vestibulares.  
2. **Research Alternatives for Embeddings**: Explore embedding methods beyond OpenAI’s API to reduce costs, such as **FAISS**, **Pinecone**, or **Hugging Face Sentence Transformers**.  
3. **Familiarization with Web Development**: Learn about sophisticated web platforms and study key tools for back-end development using FastAPI.  

### Tasks  
- Contact at least five public/private organizations requesting data on vestibulares.  
- Research embedding solutions like FAISS or Hugging Face.  
- Build a basic FastAPI back end connected to a mock database.  
- Review foundational web development courses on **MIT OpenCourseWare** and **CodeAcademy**.
