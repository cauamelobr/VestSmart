# Q1 Final Project Proposal: **VestSmart üíª - Brazilian Vestibular Chatbot**

## Project Overview 

**VestSmart** is a chatbot designed to assist Brazilian students in navigating the complex and information-heavy process of preparing for various vestibulares (university entrance exams). Unlike many other countries, Brazil‚Äôs university admission process requires students to manage extensive amounts of specific information across different exams, each with unique schedules, fees, and requirements.

## Problem Statement

Brazilian students face unique challenges when preparing for vestibulares. Each year, they must keep track of multiple exams, such as ENEM, FUVEST, and UNICAMP, all of which have specific dates, registration deadlines, fees, and formats. The volume and variability of this information can lead to stress, confusion, and even missed opportunities for students who may overlook key deadlines or requirements.

## Project Goals

VestSmart aims to address these challenges by centralizing all relevant information about vestibulares into a single, user-friendly chatbot interface. This chatbot will:

- Provide instant answers to users' questions regarding exam dates, fees, registration links, and phases for popular exams.
- Allow students to focus on studying for exams rather than searching for reliable information across multiple sources.
- Be accessible 24/7, making it a valuable resource for students across different time zones and locations in Brazil.

## Key Features

1. **Instant Access to Exam Information**: The chatbot will answer user queries with essential information about exam dates, fees, and phases.
2. **Real-Time Chat Experience**: The chatbot will mimic the experience of a real-time chat platform, using distinct styling for user and bot messages.
3. **Friendly and Contextual Responses**: The bot will handle basic conversation starters and respond in Brazilian Portuguese to ensure a natural and welcoming interaction.

## Proposal Outline

1. **Research & User Needs**: Extensive research into the popular Brazilian vestibulares and student needs, focusing on the pain points of accessing consistent, accurate information.
2. **Technology Stack**: The project will use Flask for backend API management, integrating with HTML/CSS for front-end interface design.
3. **Database Integration**: The chatbot will pull data from an internal API containing detailed information about each vestibular, which will be regularly updated.
4. **User Accessibility**: The chatbot will feature a simple and modern interface with a dark ocean-blue palette, providing a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate design.
5. **Deployment**: The chatbot will be hosted on Render, ensuring accessibility through a web link. (I am not sure tho, because during my tests it presented several limitations).

## Wireframe Sketch

A Figma wireframe has been created to showcase the structure and design of the chatbot interface. The wireframe includes:
- A banner and header with a brief description of VestSmart.
- An initial welcome message for new users.
- Clear and visually distinct separation of user and bot messages.
- A ‚ÄúDeveloped by Cau√£ Victor‚Äù footer with a clickable LinkedIn link.
